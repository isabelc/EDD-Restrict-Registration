# EDD Restrict Registration

Allow only EDD customers to register on your site.

This is useful for those who allow guest checkout and want to give their customers the ability register on the site whenever they want to.

This hooks into EDD's own shortcode, [edd_register], and stops non-customers from registering.

See the [Documentation](http://isabelcastillo.com/docs/category/edd-restrict-registration).
